Besides, his hands were full with his sister, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled.

They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear.</p><p>As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands searched for broken bones.
