<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, too convulsed with rage to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;If you strike that dog again, I'll kill you,&rdquo; he at last managed to say in a choking voice.</p><p>&ldquo;It's my dog,&rdquo; Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back. &ldquo;Get out of my way, or I'll fix you. I'm going to Dawson.&rdquo;</p><p>Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal's knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck's traces.</p></div> </div>
