I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils.&rdquo; This was Francois's speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing and Buck covered with wounds. He drew him to the fire and by its light pointed them out.</p><p>&ldquo;Dat Spitz fight lak hell,&rdquo; said Perrault, as he surveyed the gaping rips and cuts.</p><p>&ldquo;An' dat Buck fight lak two hells,&rdquo; was Francois's answer. &ldquo;An' now we make good time. No more Spitz, no more trouble, sure.&rdquo;</p><p>While Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. Buck trotted up to the place Spitz would have occupied as leader; but Francois, not noticing him, brought Sol-leks to the coveted position. In his judgment, Sol-leks was the best lead-dog left. Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury, driving him back and standing in his place.</p></div> </div>
