She dropped on her knees before Buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;You poor, poor dears,&rdquo; she cried sympathetically, &ldquo;why don't you pull hard?&mdash;then you wouldn't be whipped.&rdquo; Buck did not like her, but he was feeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day's miserable work.</p><p>One of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot speech, now spoke up:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It's not that I care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs' sakes I just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by breaking out that sled. The runners are froze fast. Throw your weight against the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
